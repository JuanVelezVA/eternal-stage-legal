# Terms of Service — The Eternal Stage
**Effective date:** [September 19, 2025]  
**Last updated:** [September 19, 2025]

Welcome to **The Eternal Stage**—a community Discord server and any related tools/bots we operate (collectively, the “Service”). By joining or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Who can use the Service
- You must be **18 years or older**.  
- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

## 2. Your content & rights
- You keep ownership of content you post. By posting, you grant us a **non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license** to display and share your content **within the server and related community materials** (e.g., event schedules, channel pins, recap posts).
- Only post content you have the rights to share. **Do not upload others’ work** (art, scripts, photos, recordings, datasets) without permission.

## 3. AI usage
- **AI is welcome.** However, **do not feed others’ work into AI tools without their permission**, and do not post AI-generated content that infringes others’ rights or violates Discord’s policies.
- You must disclose if a submission is substantially AI-generated when a channel or event specifically requests disclosure.

## 4. Community conduct
- Be respectful. No harassment, hate speech, threats, or doxxing.  
- No illegal content; no sexual content involving minors; avoid explicit gore.  
- Keep language to a **minimum level of profanity**; keep it civil.  
- Follow channel topics (e.g., Cosplay Hospital, Vendor Alley, Furry Lounge, On-Site channels, etc.).  
- No spam or mass @mentions. Use channels as intended.

## 5. Safety notes (important)
- **Cosplay Hospital, Lost & Found, and On-Site help are peer-to-peer**—they are **not emergency services**. If anyone is in danger, call local emergency services.  
- Meetups and trades are **at your own risk**. Verify people before exchanging money or goods.

## 6. Vendors & promotions
- Vendor Alley exists for showcasing products and services. Be truthful, follow laws and platform rules, and **no scams**. We may remove promotions at our discretion.

## 7. Moderation & enforcement
- We may remove content or restrict access to keep the community safe or on-topic.  
- We can suspend or ban accounts that violate these Terms or Discord’s rules.

## 8. Bot features & third parties
- The Service may integrate third-party bots or links. We are **not responsible** for third-party services or content. Use them at your own discretion.

## 9. Disclaimers & limitation of liability
- The Service is provided **“as is.”** We make **no warranties** of any kind.  
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are **not liable** for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or for user-to-user interactions, meetups, transactions, or content.

## 10. Termination
- You may leave the server at any time. We may terminate or limit access at our discretion to protect the community or comply with law/policy.

## 11. Changes to these Terms
- We may update these Terms. We’ll post changes in the server; continuing to use the Service after updates means you accept the new Terms.

## 12. Governing law & disputes
- These Terms are governed by the laws of **[your state/province, your country]**.  
- Any disputes will be handled in the courts of **[your city/state]**, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

## 13. Contact
If you have questions or concerns about these Terms, please contact us directly in the server via the Text Channels.
