The Eternal Stage bot ("the Bot") does not collect, store, or share personal information outside of Discord. The Bot only processes data necessary to provide its core features inside Discord servers.

## Data We Access
- Discord usernames, IDs, and messages only as needed to provide moderation, leveling, or community features.
- Temporary logs used to execute commands (e.g., mute, kick, or role assignments).

## Data We Do Not Collect
- We do not sell, share, or distribute any data outside of Discord.
- We do not collect sensitive personal data such as emails, addresses, or payment information.

## Data Storage
- Any temporary data is kept only as long as necessary to perform the requested command.
- Permanent storage is not used unless a server admin configures features like leveling or logs.

## Contact
If you have concerns, please reach out via **The Eternal Stage Discord server**.  
All inquiries will be reviewed by the server administration team.
